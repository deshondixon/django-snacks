## Overview

The first words you see on the Django website are

Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.

The next quote you’ll see is

The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

In this class we’ll build out a small, but functional, multi page web site using Django.

We’ll get a feel for the “Django Way” and see the dramatic performance gains you can get with a mature, robust framework.

Along the way you’ll style your site in a new way using the utility first framework TailwindCSS.

- Create website in Django with 2 pages
  - home page
    - about page
    - create views/urls/templates as needed for home and about pages
    - use ancestor template to contain navigation elements
    - Should be built the “Django way” aka match the structure of in-class demo


- Configure your project to use TailwindCSS/Flowbite
  - Just basic styling is sufficient for today, but stretch out if you’ve got time!
